# MGT-python tutorial

The presentation in this folder is automatically generated from the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-python/blob/master/musicalgestures/MusicalGesturesToolbox.ipynb) using the reveal.js framework. It is used in workshops where the learners type the commands on their own computers. If you don't want to type yourself (or copy and paste from the presentation), it is better to open the notebook itself and run the commands from there.
